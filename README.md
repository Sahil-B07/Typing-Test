## Details 
**Typing speed is measured by the number of words you can type correctly in a set amount of time. 
A “word” is equivalent to five keystrokes. During a test, both speed and accuracy are measured. You will receive a number that indicates your average words per minute (WPM) and a percentage that indicates your accuracy.**
